<h1>Paragraphs</h1>

<p><b>It was a rat's nest.</b><br>
Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take at least an <i>hour</i> to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers.</p>

<p><b>She was in a hurry.</b><br>
Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get someplace, but a <i>frantic hurry</i>. The type of hurry where a few seconds could mean <i>life or death</i>. She raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead.</p>
